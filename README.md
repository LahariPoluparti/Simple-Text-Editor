# Simple-Text-Editor
I created a simple text editor using Tkinter and Python3 named Scribble.

This text editor has 2 main sub categories:
  1. File
  2. Edit
  
 Both the menus have further submenus to enhance the features of the editor
 
 File:
  1. New File
  2. Open
  3. Save
  4. Save As
  5. Exit
  
 Edit:
  1. Undo
  2. Redo
  3. Cut
  4. Copy
  5. Paste
